          I am passionate about creating modern design for web and mobile. My
          strengths include HTML5, CSS3/SASS, and JavaScript. Continual
          education and being relevant on new trends are both very important to
          me. It isnâ€™t uncommon to find me coding through the weekends or on the
          road. Check out my latest projects below or view more on{' '}
